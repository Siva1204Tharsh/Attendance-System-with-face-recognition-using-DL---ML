# Attendance-System-with-face-recognition-using-DL & ML
## Attendance System
• Face recognition is a method of identifying or 
verifying the identity of an individual using their 
face. Face recognition systems can be used to 
identify people in photos, video, or in real-time.
• The attendance system will track employee 
location, time of clocking/out, and the report 
recorded. The attendance system will then 
process the data, to produce timesheet reports, 
lateness reports, absence reports, task and 
request reports.

## Machine Learnnig Algorithm
Support vector machines (SVM)
• Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful yet flexible supervised 
machine learning algorithms which are used both for classification and 
regression.
• The goal of SVM is to divide the datasets into classes to find a 
maximum marginal hyperplane (MMH).
• Support Vectors − Datapoints that are closest to the hyperplane is 
called support vectors. Separating line will be defined with the help of 
these data points.
• Hyperplane − As we can see in the above diagram, it is a decision plane 
or space which is divided between a set of objects having different 
classes.
• Margin − It may be defined as the gap between two lines on the closet 
data points of different classes. It can be calculated as the 
perpendicular distance from the line to the support vectors. Large 
margin is considered as a good margin and small margin is considered
